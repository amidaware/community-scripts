"""
This PC online check script will alert when a PC comes online. It does this by pinging an IP or host, preferably the
RMM server.

In Tactical RMM, a return code of 0 indicates success.
  - If the ping is not successful, a return code of 1 used to indicate failure so an alert can be sent.
  - If the ping is successful, a return code of 0 is used to indicate success and no alert is sent.

Command line arguments:
  There are no command line arguments. All parameters are passed using environmental variables.

Environmental variables:
  - PING_HOSTNAME: Hostname or IP to ping. Default: localhost
    The hostname or IP to ping. If not set, "localhost" is used.

  - PING_TIMEOUT: Timeout, in seconds. Default: 5
    The timeout in seconds for the ping arguments. The ping command has various timeouts in various arguments on
    different systems. PING_TIMEOUT is used for those arguments. An additional timeout of PING_TIMEOUT + 1 is used
    for Python to time out the exec. The idea is that the ping timeout arguments will cause the exec to return before
    Pythong kills the program.

  - PING_STACKTRACE: Include the stack trace on error?
    If true, the stacktrace is included in the output on failure. This may or may not be useful.
    Note: In true Python sense, the value needs to be PascalCase: True

Possible enhancements:
  Use ping3[1] or tcping[2] which do not require exec'ing an external program. The down side is they require
  installing another module.

    ping a host with a timeout and return the result and output. If the "ping" command generates an error,
    the output will include the stacktrace if "stacktrace" is True.

    The timeout is the number of seconds for the ping command options, and number of seconds + 1 for Python to
    time out the ping command. A timeout of 1 or 2 seconds is suggested.

    Remember that a host may not respond to a ping (ICMP) request even if the host name is valid.
